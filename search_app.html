  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What are the four main principles of OOP?",
    "Answer": "Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is the difference between abstraction and encapsulation?",
    "Answer": "Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only functionality, while encapsulation binds data and methods together and restricts direct access to data."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is polymorphism and what are its types?",
    "Answer": "Polymorphism allows objects of different types to be treated as objects of a common type. Types: Compile-time (method overloading) and Runtime (method overriding)."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is inheritance and what are its types?",
    "Answer": "Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and behaviors of another class. Types: Single, Multiple (through interfaces), Multilevel, Hierarchical, Hybrid."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is the difference between abstract class and interface?",
    "Answer": "Abstract class can have abstract and concrete methods, constructors, and instance variables. Interface can only have abstract methods (until Java 8), constants, and supports multiple inheritance."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is method overloading vs method overriding?",
    "Answer": "Overloading: Same method name, different parameters, compile-time polymorphism. Overriding: Same method signature in subclass, runtime polymorphism."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is the 'super' keyword used for?",
    "Answer": "To refer immediate parent class instance variable, invoke parent class method, or invoke parent class constructor."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is the 'this' keyword used for?",
    "Answer": "To refer current class instance variable, invoke current class method, invoke current class constructor, or pass as argument in method/constructor."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is static binding and dynamic binding?",
    "Answer": "Static binding: Resolved at compile time (private, final, static methods). Dynamic binding: Resolved at runtime (overridden methods)."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "OOP Concepts",
    "Question": "What is composition in Java?",
    "Answer": "Composition is a 'has-a' relationship where one class contains reference to another class, providing stronger coupling than inheritance."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList?",
    "Answer": "ArrayList uses dynamic array, better for random access. LinkedList uses doubly linked list, better for frequent insertions/deletions."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the difference between HashMap and ConcurrentHashMap?",
    "Answer": "HashMap is not thread-safe, ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe and allows concurrent read operations without locking."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the contract between equals() and hashCode()?",
    "Answer": "If two objects are equal according to equals(), they must have the same hashCode. If two objects have same hashCode, they may not be equal."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the difference between HashSet and TreeSet?",
    "Answer": "HashSet uses HashMap internally, unordered. TreeSet uses TreeMap, maintains natural ordering or custom comparator."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the difference between HashMap and HashTable?",
    "Answer": "HashMap is not synchronized, allows one null key and multiple null values. HashTable is synchronized, doesn't allow null keys or values."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is fail-fast and fail-safe iterator?",
    "Answer": "Fail-fast throws ConcurrentModificationException if collection is modified during iteration. Fail-safe doesn't throw exception, works on clone."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is the difference between Comparable and Comparator?",
    "Answer": "Comparable provides single sorting sequence, modifies original class. Comparator provides multiple sorting sequences, doesn't modify original class."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "How does HashMap work internally?",
    "Answer": "Uses array of nodes (buckets), uses hashCode to find bucket, handles collisions using linked list or tree (Java 8+)."
  },
  {
    "Category": "Core Java",
    "Subcategory": "Collections",
    "Question": "What is LinkedHashMap?",
    "Answer": "Extends HashMap, maintains insertion order using doubly-linked list running through all entries."
  },

Without the volatile keyword on the instance field, it is broken because a partially constructed object might be visible to other threads due to instruction reordering, even after the lock is released. The volatile keyword prevents this reordering, ensuring a happens-before relationship.",

Method calls within a @Configuration class that are annotated with @Bean are intercepted to ensure the singleton nature of the bean (i.e., the same instance is returned on subsequent calls). In a @Component class with @Bean methods, this interception does not occur, so each method call would create a new instance, breaking the singleton scope unless the method is static.",

    "Answer": "The 'Open Session in View' (OSIV) pattern keeps a Hibernate Session (or JPA EntityManager) open for the entire duration of a web request, typically until the view rendering is complete. This is discouraged because it can lead to lazy loading exceptions being triggered outside of the transactional boundary, unintended database queries during view rendering (the 'N+1 selects' problem), and difficulty in debugging performance issues. It's better to fetch all required data explicitly within a well-defined transactional service layer.",

A multi-stage build allows you to use one stage (e.g., with the full Maven/Gradle and JDK) to compile and package the application, and then copy only the resulting JAR file and necessary runtime into a second, minimal stage (e.g., with just a JRE). This eliminates build tools and intermediate files from the final image, reducing its size and attack surface.",
